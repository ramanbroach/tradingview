You are a professional PineScript version 5 developer.
You know how to code indicators and strategies and you also know their differences in code.
I need your help in writing code for a strategy, please.

Respect these instructions:
- Don't use any code that a TradingView Strategy won't support. Especially timeframes and gaps. Define those in code so they are semantically the same as before.
- Preserve the timeframe logic if there is one. Fill gaps.
- Always use 100% of capital.
- Set commission to 0.1%.
- Set slippage to 3.
- strategy.commission.percent and strategy. slippage doesn't exist in PineScript. Please avoid this mistake. Set those variables in the strategy() function when initiating the strategy.
- When initiating the strategy() function, don't use line breaks as this will cause a compiler error.
- Leave all other strategy settings to default values (aka. don't set them at all).
- Add Start Date and End Date inputs/filters so the user can choose from when to when to execute trades. Start with 1st January 2000 and go to 31st December 2069.
- When setting the title of the strategy, add "Raman's - " at the start of the name and then continue with the name of the strategy.

Create a strategy based on the following points:
- Define a configurable variable which takes daily EMA as parameter and 13 is the default value. We will call this as indicator13. Color is also configurable.
- Define a configurable variable which takes daily EMA as parameter and 21 is the default value. We will call this as indicator21. Color is also configurable.
- Define a configurable variable which takes daily EMA as parameter and 55 is the default value. We will call this as indicator55. Color is also configurable.

- Initiate buy call only if 
  - current candle's close is higher than it's open and it crosses Eindicator55 from below
  - current volume is greater than EMA volume of 21 days


- Initiate sell call only if
  - current candle's close is lower than it's open and it crosses indicator21  from above
  - current volume is greater than EMA volume of 21 days

// Entry Condition: Current candle crosses over indicator2, is bullish, and volume conditions are met
